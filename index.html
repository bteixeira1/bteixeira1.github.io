<p><a href="http://hikethehudsonvalley.com/">Hike The Hudson Valley</a> is an incredible tool for an aspiring hiker. It has step-by-step trail guides to 73 of the best hikes in the Hudson Valley. Upon further review of the makeup and syntax of this website, I would have to say that the code quality is appropriate for its purpose. The website is simple to navigate, has great graphics and simply just works. After viewing the source code, I have been able to get a sense of how everything on the page is organized. I have also certainly recognized a couple of tags such as the title tag, the footer tag and the img tag. One tag that I am not completely familiar with but is the link tag. My guess is that this tag links a special element of another page to this one. Overall although it could certainly use some improvement, I am pleased with the code quality of Hike The Hudson Valley.
